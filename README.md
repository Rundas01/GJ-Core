# Gregicality Legacy Reimagined

**Gregicality Legacy Reimagined** is a revision of **Gregicality Legacy** for **GregTech Community Edition** and is one module of Gregicality for **GregTech Community Edition Unofficial**.

This mod expands GTCEu with UV+ endgame content, making higer tiers as interesting and challenging as earlier tiers by adding several singleblock
and multiblock machines, _a lot_ of new materials, a revisioned nuclear system, more integration with Forestry in the form of more bees and combs
(including magic species if Thaumcraft and/or Astral Sorcery are installed) as well as planetary species if Galacticraft is installed.
